 Iâ€™m an B.Arch student from the island of Cyprus currently enrolled in my last
 year of college. I have groved up on the mediterenean coast and located to
 Chicago for college and sinhce have been living in Chicago for the past five
 years and really enjoy the urban lifestyle as well as architecture.

My education specializes in computational design and reflects interests in
experimentation through contemporary digital tools and the desire to merge
architecture with alternative fields of design. i have experience working
with various architectural studios of different backgrounds.From
international architects such as Emre Arolat (Istanbul), Krueck & Sexton
(Chicago) and currently Kwong von Glinow, my free time from school is occupied
by our current installation/pavilion for the Chicago river walk completing in
may. I have contributed to projects in various scales however, my true passion
 lies within the architectural scale of inhabitable art installations.My
current personal project in collaboration with my friends is a proposal for
the Burning Man gathering in Black Rock City Nevada which explores the
topic of metaphysics, multi dimensionality and ephemerality. I also
currently holds an executive position at the student run gallery AxA and
have experience in exhibitions and displays, leading exhibitions such as
the Bauhaus Archives in 2018.

My nearest future plans include completing our current art installation Harmony
Of the Spheres in the AxA gallery at Illinois Tech before taking it to Nevada for
the Burning man festival. Moreover, before leaving USA i would like to take
advantage of my STEM visa privilege and live in New York for a year. In two
years i would like to enroll in A graduate school program located in London to
continue my exploration with digital design.
