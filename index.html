 My education specializes in computational design and reflects interests in
experimentation through contemporary digital tools and the desire to merge
architecture with alternative fields of design. i have experience working
with various architectural studios of different backgrounds.From
international architects such as Emre Arolat (Istanbul), Krueck & Sexton
(Chicago) and currently Kwong von Glinow, my free time from school is occupied
by our current installation/pavilion for the Chicago river walk completing
in may. I have contributed to projects in various scales however, my true
passion lies within the architectural scale inhabitable art installations.My
current personal project in collaboration with my friends is a proposal for
the Burning Man gathering in Black Rock City Nevada which explores the
topic of metaphysics, multi dimensionality and ephemerality. I also
currently holds an executive position at the student run gallery AxA and
have experience in exhibitions and displays, leading exhibitions such as
the Bauhaus Archives in 2018.
